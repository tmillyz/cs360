Event Tracking App
Summary of Requirements and Goals
This app was developed to help users track upcoming events by allowing them to add, view, and manage event details. The app addresses the needs of users who require a reliable method to organize and be reminded of important events.

Screens and Features
The app includes the following screens:

Login Screen: Allows user authentication.
Event List Screen: Displays all upcoming events.
Event Detail Screen: Provides detailed information about a specific event.
Add Event Screen: Lets users create new events.
Edit Event Screen: Allows users to modify existing events.
The UI was designed with simplicity and user-friendliness in mind, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the app and complete tasks efficiently. The design was successful due to its intuitive layout and straightforward functionality.

Coding Approach
The app was coded with modularity and reusability in mind. Techniques such as creating reusable methods and using Android's SQLite database for persistent storage were employed. These strategies are beneficial for maintaining and updating the app in the future.

Testing Process
The app was tested using the Android Emulator, with various inputs and scenarios to ensure all features worked as intended. Breakpoints were set during development to monitor the app's behavior in real-time, ensuring that any issues were promptly identified and addressed. Testing is crucial as it reveals potential bugs and ensures the app's reliability.

Innovation and Challenges
During development, integrating the SMS notification feature presented a challenge, particularly ensuring the app remained functional if the user denied SMS permissions. This required innovative coding solutions to handle different user responses effectively.

Demonstrated Knowledge
The successful implementation of the SQLite database to manage and persist event data demonstrates my strong understanding of mobile app development and database management.
